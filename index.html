                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A massive data breach has occurred at Facebook compromising the information
                            of over 500 millin people. If you use Facebook, be wary
                            of potential incoming phishing attempts from any sources. Although there was no highly
                            confidential
                            information leaked such as social security numbers or credit card numbers, the data that was
                            leaked
                            could include: Facebook ID, full name, location, birthday, and most importantly: phone
                            number and email.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This breach affects people from over 100 countries including 32 million
                            individuals data from the USA, 11 million from the UK, and 6 million from India.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How it happened.</h3>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            The data breach is believed to relate to a vulnerability which Facebook reportedly fixed in
                            August of 2019. While the exact source of the data canâ€™t be verified, it was likely acquired
                            through the misuse of legitimate functions in the Facebook systems.

                            Such misuses can occur when a seemingly innocent feature of a website is used for an
                            unexpected purpose by attackers, as was the case with a PayID attack in 2019.

                            This breach occured when attackers abused a flaw in a Facebook address book contacts import
                            feature.
                            Facebook says it patched the vulnerability in August 2019, but it's unclear how many times
                            the bug was exploited before then. The information from more than 500 million Facebook users
                            in more than 106 countries contains Facebook IDs, phone numbers, and other information about
                            early Facebook users like Mark Zuckerburg and US secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg,
                            as well as the European Union commissioner for data protection, Didier Reynders. Other
                            victims include 61 people who list the "Federal Trade Commission" and 651 people who list
                            "Attorney General" in their details on Facebook.

                        </p>

                        <p>As you can see from this data visualizer of the largest web companies in the past ten years
                            Facebook has had multiple substantial data breaches in the last couple years. More worrying
                            though is the means of the data breach. Occuring usually via the companies own tools. </p>
